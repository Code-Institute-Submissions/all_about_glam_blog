## About
This application is a blogpost and it was created for users to get inspired and share anything related to beauty. Users can create an account where they can add as many blogposts as they like for free! Plus they can update or edit their posts and profile account. 

## Why This Project?
This application was created for my 3rd Project with Data Centric Development for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). I used Python and a no-SQL database, MongoDB, to create this project which uses CRUD operations to allow users to create, read, update and delete their posts.

## UX

### User Stories
* As a user, I want to be able to create my own account.
* As a user, I want to be able to log in and out of my account.
* As a user, I want to be able to create a blog post.
* As a user, I want to read inspiring posts from the web application.
* As a user, I want to be able to edit and update my blog posts.
* As a user, I want to be able to edit my profile account.
* As a user, I want to be able to delete my blog posts.
* As a user, I want to be able to my profile account.
